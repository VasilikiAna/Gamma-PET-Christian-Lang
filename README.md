# Geometry used in Christian's thesis

The files included in this branch are:

- File containing the geometrical arrangement of the detectors (Geometry set-up file, MyGeoSetUpNew.geo.setup)
- Materials file (Materials.geo)
- File containing information about the Volume & shape of detectors (MyGeoNew.geo)
- File containing information about energy/position resolution of detectors (MyDetNew.det)
- Source file for the simulation (Megalibscript.sh)
- .dat file for the Na-22 sources
- 3 Pictures taken from Christian's Thesis representing the Detector Geometry, the 3 Na-22 Point Sources, and the Image Reconstruction of the sources using the Gamma-PET method
