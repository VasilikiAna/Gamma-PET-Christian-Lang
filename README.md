# Geometry used in Christian's thesis

The files included in this branch are:

- File containing the geometrical arrangement of the detectors (Geometry set-up file, MyGeoSetUpNew.geo.setup)
- Materials file (Materials.geo)
- File containing information about the Volume & shape of detectors (MyGeoNew.geo)
- File containing information about energy/position resolution of detectors (MyDetNew.det)
- Source file that I used to run the simulation in the cluster (Megalibscript.sh)
