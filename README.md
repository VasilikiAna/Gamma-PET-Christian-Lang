Event Reconstruction from the intersection between the Compton Cone of the third, prompt photon &amp; the LOR from the positron annhilitation.
The following header & source files of the MEGAlib software had been editted:
- MImagerExternallyManaged.h
- MBackprojection.h
- MBackprojectionSphere.h
- MBackprojectionSphereArea.h
- MBackprojectionSpherePoints.h
- MBaackprojectionCartesian.h

- MBackprojectionCartesian.cxx
- MImagerExternallyManaged.cxx
- MBackprojectionSphere.cxx

The Analysis code that Christian used for his reconstruction was published in his thesis as a pdf file & I copied-pasted it in the AnalysisCode.cxx file
